To make a map, type in a number at the very top of the text file.
Letters correspond to different tiles.

S-start location (include this)
X-wall tiles
O-path tiles
E-end tile (step on it to win)
A-spike tile (die if you step on it)
C-coin tile
H-hidden path tile(looks like a wall, but can move through it)
K-key tile (needed to open exit in maze)
Q-brown wall tiles (use a switch to open them)
P-switch tile (step on to open brown wall tiles)


/********************************
Preconditions: 
ENTER IN A NUMBER AT THE TOP LINE, BETWEEN 1 AND 28
(otherwise it won't fit on screen)
MUST HAVE EQUAL NUMBER OF ROWS TO THE NUMBER AT TOP

**************************************/

An example for a map would be:

5
XXXXX
XAOOX
XOEOX
XSOOX
XXXXX

This would generate a 5x5 map, surrounded by walls.
End tile is at center, lava tile at top left, starting spot at bot left.
